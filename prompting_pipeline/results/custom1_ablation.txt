## Efficient Compiler Optimization Passes for LLVM IR Code:

Based on the provided LLVM IR, here are some efficient optimization passes you can consider:

**General Optimizations:**

* **Mem2Reg:** This pass promotes alloca instructions to SSA registers, eliminating unnecessary memory accesses and improving register allocation. 
* **Dead Code Elimination:** Removes instructions that have no effect on the output, reducing code size and improving execution speed.

* **Link Time Optimization (LTO):** Performs optimizations across multiple translation units, enabling more aggressive optimizations that consider the entire program.

**Applying Optimizations:**

Use the `opt` tool provided by LLVM to apply these passes. You can specify multiple passes in a sequence to achieve the desired level of optimization. 

**Remember:** 

* The effectiveness of each pass depends on the specific code and target architecture. 
* Analyze the generated code and performance to ensure optimizations are beneficial and do not introduce regressions.

By applying these optimization techniques and carefully evaluating the results, you can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of the compiled code.

GPT-4 PROMPT 1:
For the LLVM IR code provided, an efficient selection of compiler optimization passes will target specific inefficiencies and redundancies. Here, I will outline some vital passes that could substantially improve the performance and reduce the size of the compiled program:

1. **mem2reg (Memory to Register Promotion)**: This pass is crucial as it moves stack-based variables into registers, which is beneficial for speed, especially in the provided code where there are a significant number of `alloca` and `load/store` operations that interact frequently with memory.

2. **instcombine (Combine Instructions)**: This pass simplifies redundant and complicated instruction patterns into simpler and more efficient instructions. It can help in cleaning up after other optimizations like `mem2reg`.

3. **simplifycfg (Simplify the Control-Flow Graph)**: This pass removes unnecessary control flow blocks, consolidates branches, and simplifies control flow, which can help streamline the execution paths in the function.

4. **indvars (Canonicalize Induction Variables)**: This is valuable for loops, as it simplifies loop induction variables, which could improve the loop performance and help other loop optimizations to be more effective.

5. **licm (Loop Invariant Code Motion)**: This moves code that computes the same result on every iteration of the loop outside the loop, thereby reducing the computational load inside the loop.

6. **loop-rotate (Loop Rotation)**: Helps by repositioning the loop’s condition check to the end, which in many cases increases performance by reordering loop exits and allowing further loop optimizations.

7. **gvn (Global Value Numbering)**: Eliminates redundant calculations throughout the functions, which could enhance both space and time efficiency by reusing previously computed values.

8. **function-attrs (Function Attributes Inference)**: Deduces attributes for functions which can give hints to the compiler for further optimizations about how functions are used (e.g., `readnone`, `readonly`).

9. **loop-unroll (Loop Unroll)**: This pass can expand loops by replicating their body; it’s crucial when loops are small or have a statically-known small trip count. This can help reduce loop overhead.

10. **inline (Function Integration/Inlining)**: Even though the attributes suggest `noinline`, selectively inlining small utility functions (if any exist outside the provided code) can significantly reduce call overhead.

11. **dce (Dead Code Elimination)**: Eliminates code that does not affect the program, reducing the code size and potentially removing unused branches or instructions post other optimizations.

12. **jump-threading (Jump Threading)**: This pass can simplify conditional branches with fixed outcomes, which often arises after other analysis and simplifications have been performed.

13. **sroa (Scalar Replacement of Aggregates)**: Useful in breaking down aggregates into individual scalars, which can be optimized further.

14. **tailcallelim (Tail Call Elimination)**: Optimizes tail calls into jumps within the same function, useful in recursive function scenarios to reduce call overhead.

15. **constmerge (Constant Merging)**: This reduces memory usage by merging identical global constants.

Each of these optimizations should be tested for their impacts individually and in combination to understand their effects on the specific codebase they are applied to. Furthermore, profiling could dictate the focus of certain optimizations, especially around loops and function calls.

GPT-4 PROMPT 2:
Given the nature of the LLVM IR generated from the C source code provided, several compiler optimization passes can be employed to potentially improve performance and efficiency. Most of the optimization opportunities lie in loop optimizations, function inlining, and constant propagation. Here’s a list of appropriate LLVM passes that might be beneficial:

1. **Function Inlining** (`-inline`):
   - The `@doing_something` function and potentially other smaller functions might be good candidates for inlining to eliminate the function call overhead, which is relevant despite the `noinline` attribute (if it's feasible to ignore or alter this directive in a practical scenario).

2. **Loop Unrolling** (`-loop-unroll`):
   - This optimization expands the loop body to reduce the loop overhead and increase parallelism. Loops in `@normal_factorial`, `@main`, and `@doing_something` could be considered for unrolling.
   
3. **Loop Vectorization** (`-loop-vectorize`):
   - This employs SIMD capabilities on the processor. The computational loops within the `@doing_something` and `@main` functions may benefit from vectorization to perform multiple iterations simultaneously.

4. **Simplify CFG** (`-simplifycfg`):
   - This pass simplifies the control flow graph by removing unnecessary control flow elements. All functions could benefit since redundant branches and conditionals may exist.

5. **Dead Code Elimination** (`-dce`):
   - This optimizes out code that computes values but does not use them and can be applied post-inlining or other transformations that may introduce unneeded instructions.

6. **Global Value Numbering** (`-gvn`):
   - This optimization works on eliminating redundant calculations through value numbering. This may be particularly relevant in `@doing_something` where calculations seem to be repeated.

7. **Constant Propagation** (`-constprop`):
   - Substitutes values of known constants in expressions, which might be beneficial in initializing phases of functions like `@main` where `@__const.main.as` and `@__const.main.bs` constants are frequently accessed.

8. **Eliminate unnecessary memory operations** (`-mem2reg`):
   - Converts memory residency of values into SSA form, which strives to reduce and optimize the load and store operations, generally increasing performance by harnessing faster access to registers compared to memory.

9. **Scalar Replacement of Aggregates** (`-sroa`):
   - Breaks down aggregates into individual scalar values enabling better optimization of these uses on a fine-grained scale. This could potentially be utilized for simplifying the structures manipulated in `@main`.

10. **Tail Call Optimization** (`-tailcallelim`):
    - Although no direct opportunities within the provided code seem apparent, if any function redesigns into a form that enables tail recursion, applying this pass can optimize such calls into jumps instead of function calls.

After choosing the relevant optimization passes, the exact order and combination would need experimentation and profiling to verify improvements, as LLVM transformations can interact in complex ways, not always leading to expected performance enhancements. Optimizing with the attribute directives (`noinline`, `optnone`) noted in your code would typically require removing these restrictions to allow for broader optimization application.
