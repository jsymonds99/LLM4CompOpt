## Optimization Pass Recommendations based on Profile Data:

**General Observations:**

* The profile data suggests frequent loop executions and conditional branches.
* Functions are marked `noinline`, so inlining is not immediately applicable.

**Suggested Optimization Passes:**

1. **Loop Optimizations:**
    * **licm (Loop Invariant Code Motion):** Move invariant computations out of loops in `find_max`, `find_min`, and the nested loops in `main`.
    * **loop-unroll (Loop Unrolling):** Consider unrolling the inner loop in `main` due to its small size and frequent execution.
    * **loop-reduce (Loop Strength Reduction):** Analyze loops for potential strength reduction opportunities, especially in calculations involving induction variables.

2. **Value Numbering and Simplification:**
    * **gvn (Global Value Numbering):** Eliminate redundant computations within and across functions, considering the frequent calls to `find_max` and `find_min`.
    * **instcombine + aggressive-instcombine:** Combine instructions for simplification and potential loop optimization opportunities.

    * **jump-threading:** Analyze and optimize control flow by removing unnecessary jumps and streamlining branch targets.
    * **simplifycfg:** Clean up the control flow graph for better efficiency and readability.

4. **Code Generation Optimizations:**
    * **codegenprepare:** Prepare the code for efficient code generation, especially given the mathematical operations and function calls. 
    * **mem2reg:** Promote memory access to register access where possible for improved performance. 

5. **Dead Code Elimination:**
    * **dce (Dead Code Elimination):** Remove any dead code that might be present after other optimizations.
    * **dse (Dead Store Elimination):** Eliminate redundant or unnecessary stores to memory locations.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO):** If available, utilize PGO to further tailor optimizations based on runtime behavior.
* **Function Attributes:** Analyze functions with **function-attrs** to potentially discover attributes like `readnone` and `readonly` that can guide further optimizations.

**Order of Passes:**

The order of applying these passes can significantly impact the effectiveness of optimizations. Generally, follow this sequence:

1. **Value Numbering and Simplification**
2. **Control Flow Optimizations**
3. **Loop Optimizations**
4. **Code Generation Optimizations**
5. **Dead Code Elimination** 

**Note:** This is a general recommendation. The optimal sequence may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the code and the target architecture. Experimentation and profiling are crucial to determine the most effective optimization strategy. 


GEMINI PROMPT 2:
## Inefficiencies in the Code Snippet:

Here's an analysis of potential inefficiencies within the provided LLVM IR code:

**1. Redundant Loads and Stores:**

*   There are numerous instances where values are loaded from memory, used in a computation, and then stored back to the same memory location within the same basic block. This is unnecessary and can be optimized by using the value directly in registers without the extra memory accesses. Examples include:
    *   Lines 11-12 in `find_max`: The value of `%8` is loaded twice.
    *   Lines 14-16 in `find_max`: The value of `%4` is loaded, used in a computation, and then stored back to `%9`.

**2. Repeated Computations within Loops:**

*   Several calculations are performed repeatedly within loops, even though their values remain constant throughout the loop's iterations. These computations can be moved outside the loop (loop-invariant code motion) to avoid redundant work. Examples:
    *   Lines 15-16 and 18-19 in `find_max`: The conversions of `%15` and `%18` to double are repeated in each iteration.

**3. Unnecessary Function Calls:**

*   The `find_max` and `find_min` functions are very similar, with only the comparison operator being different. These functions could potentially be combined into a single function with a flag to control the comparison type, reducing code duplication and function call overhead.

**4. Inefficient Loop Structure:**

*   The nested loops in the `main` function have complex conditions and branching, which can hinder optimization efforts. Simplifying the loop structure and conditions could improve the effectiveness of loop-based optimization passes. 

**5. Lack of Function Attributes:**

*   The functions lack attributes like `readonly` or `readnone`, which could provide the optimizer with more information about the functions' behavior and enable more aggressive optimizations. 

## Potential Optimization Passes:

Based on the identified inefficiencies, the following LLVM transformation passes could be beneficial:

*   **Mem2Reg:** This pass would promote stack allocations to registers, reducing the need for load/store instructions and improving performance.
*   **InstCombine:** This pass would combine instructions and simplify expressions, addressing the redundant computations and potentially eliminating dead code. 
*   **GVN (Global Value Numbering):** This pass could identify and eliminate redundant calculations within and across basic blocks.
*   **LICM (Loop Invariant Code Motion):** This pass would move loop-invariant computations outside the loop, reducing the amount of work done within each iteration.
*   **Loop Simplify:** This pass could help restructure the loops to be more amenable to further optimizations.
*   **FunctionAttrs:** This pass could analyze the functions and add attributes to provide more information to the optimizer. 

## Additional Considerations:

*   **Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO):** If profile data is available, PGO can provide the optimizer with information about the program's runtime behavior, allowing for more informed decisions during optimization.
*   **Loop Unrolling:** Depending on the loop characteristics and target architecture, loop unrolling could improve performance by reducing loop overhead and increasing instruction-level parallelism.

**Disclaimer:** The effectiveness of these optimization passes depends on the specific characteristics of the code and the target architecture. It's recommended to experiment with different passes and measure their impact on performance to determine the optimal optimization strategy.
## Optimizing Redundant Loads and Stores:

One of the most significant inefficiencies identified in the code is the presence of redundant loads and stores.  Let's focus on optimizing this aspect using the **Mem2Reg** LLVM transformation pass.

### Mem2Reg Pass:

The Mem2Reg pass promotes stack allocations (allocas) to SSA registers, effectively removing the need for load and store instructions when accessing these variables. This optimization reduces memory traffic and improves performance by keeping values in faster registers.

**How Mem2Reg Works:**

1. **Identify Promotable Allocas:** The pass analyzes the code to find allocas that are only used within a single basic block and meet specific criteria for promotion.  These criteria ensure that promoting the alloca to a register wouldn't introduce complications with control flow or aliasing.
2. **Create Phi Nodes:** For allocas used in multiple predecessor blocks, the pass inserts phi nodes at the beginning of the block to merge values from different incoming paths. 
3. **Replace Memory Accesses:**  The pass replaces load and store instructions that access the promotable allocas with register references.
4. **Remove Allocas:** Once all uses of the alloca have been replaced, the alloca instruction itself is removed.

**Example:**

In the `find_max` function, the variable `%9` is a prime candidate for promotion by Mem2Reg. It is allocated with an alloca instruction, assigned a value, and then immediately loaded again before being used in a comparison. This can be optimized as follows:

```llvm
; Before Mem2Reg
  store double %26, ptr %9, align 8  ; Store the computed value
  %27 = load double, ptr %9, align 8 ; Load the value immediately
  %28 = load double, ptr %7, align 8
  %29 = fcmp ogt double %27, %28    ; Compare with the current maximum

; After Mem2Reg
  %27 = fadd double %24, %25       ; Compute the value (no store)
  %28 = load double, ptr %7, align 8
  %29 = fcmp ogt double %27, %28    ; Directly use the computed value
```

By applying Mem2Reg, the unnecessary store and load instructions are removed, resulting in more efficient code.

**Applying Mem2Reg:**

To apply the Mem2Reg pass using the `opt` command-line tool, you can use the following command:

```bash
opt -mem2reg <input-llvm-file> -o <output-llvm-file> 
```

This will optimize the LLVM IR in the input file and write the optimized version to the output file.

**Additional Benefits:**

*   Promoting allocas to registers can expose additional optimization opportunities for other passes, such as GVN and InstCombine, leading to further performance improvements.
*   Reducing memory traffic can improve cache locality and reduce pressure on the memory subsystem, benefiting overall system performance. 


## Optimizing Repeated Computations:

Another significant inefficiency is the repeated calculations within loops, particularly those involving type conversions.  The **LICM (Loop Invariant Code Motion)** pass can address this issue.

### LICM Pass:

LICM identifies computations within a loop that produce the same value in every iteration (loop-invariant) and hoists them out of the loop. This reduces the amount of work performed within the loop, improving efficiency.

**How LICM Works:**

1. **Identify Loop-Invariant Instructions:**  The pass analyzes the loop to determine which instructions have operands that remain constant throughout the loop's execution.
2. **Check for Dependencies:** The pass verifies that hoisting the instruction out of the loop wouldn't introduce dependencies or change the program's semantics.
3. **Move Instructions:**  Loop-invariant instructions that meet the criteria are moved to a location before the loop begins, and their results are reused within the loop.

**Example:**

In the `find_max` function, the conversion of `%15` and `%18` to double using `sitofp` instructions are performed in each loop iteration, even though these values don't change within the loop. LICM can move these conversions outside the loop:

```llvm
; Before LICM (inside the loop)
  %15 = load i32, ptr %8, align 4
  %16 = sitofp i32 %15 to double  ; Repeated conversion
  ...
  %18 = load i32, ptr %8, align 4
  %19 = sitofp i32 %18 to double  ; Repeated conversion

; After LICM (before the loop) 
  %15 = load i32, ptr %8, align 4
  %16 = sitofp i32 %15 to double
  ...
  br label %10                 ; Start of the loop

10:
  ...                          ; Use %16 and %19 directly within the loop
```

By applying LICM, the redundant type conversions are eliminated, leading to faster loop execution.

## Optimizing the LLVM IR Code: A Walkthrough

**Initial Observations:**

- The code contains two functions, `find_max` and `find_min`, with very similar structures. This suggests opportunities for code refactoring and optimization. 
- Both functions contain a loop with several calculations and memory accesses. 
- The `main` function has nested loops and calls to `find_max` and `find_min`.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. **Simplify and Clean Up:**
    - **`instcombine`:** This is a fundamental pass that simplifies instructions and expressions, potentially enabling further optimizations. 
    - **`dce` and `dse`:** Remove dead code and dead stores, eliminating unnecessary instructions and memory operations.
    - **`simplifycfg`:** Clean up the control flow graph by removing unreachable blocks and simplifying branches.

2. **Improve Function Efficiency:**
    - **`mem2reg`:** Allocate stack variables to registers where possible, improving data access speed.
    - **`reassociate`:** Reorder calculations to potentially create more opportunities for constant folding and other optimizations.
    - **`loop-unroll` (Considered, but might not be optimal):** Unroll inner loops to potentially improve data locality and instruction-level parallelism. However, this needs careful evaluation as it can increase code size.

3. **Loop Optimizations:**
    - **`licm`:** Move loop-invariant computations outside the loop, reducing redundant calculations.
    - **`indvars`:** Canonicalize induction variables to simplify loop analysis and enable further optimizations.
    - **`loop-strength-reduce`:** Replace expensive operations with cheaper equivalents, e.g., replacing multiplications with additions where applicable.

4. **Global Optimizations:**
    - **`gvn`:** Identify and eliminate redundant computations across the entire program.
    - **`constmerge`:** Merge identical global constants to reduce memory usage.

5. **Code Size Reduction:**
    - **`strip`:** Remove debugging information and unnecessary symbols to reduce code size. 

**Pass Selection Rationale:**

- The initial passes focus on simplifying the codebase and preparing it for more advanced optimizations.
- `mem2reg` is chosen due to the presence of several local variables that can potentially be allocated to registers, improving data access times. 
- Loop optimizations are crucial due to the presence of nested loops in the `main` function and the core loops within `find_max` and `find_min`.
- `gvn` and `constmerge` are global optimizations that can further improve code efficiency and reduce redundancy.
- Finally, `strip` can be used to reduce the size of the generated code if debugging information is not required.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Profile-guided Optimization (PGO):** If available, profile data can guide the compiler to make more informed decisions about inlining, loop unrolling, and other optimizations.
- **Function Inlining:** Inlining `find_max` and `find_min` into `main` could be beneficial, but a cost-benefit analysis based on function size and call frequency is necessary. 
- **Vectorization:** Depending on the target architecture and the compiler's capabilities, vectorization could be explored to perform operations on multiple data elements simultaneously.

**Note:** The effectiveness of each optimization pass depends on the specific code and target platform. It is important to experiment and measure the impact of each pass to determine the optimal optimization strategy. 


-----------------------------

GPT-4 PROMPT 1:
Given the provided profile data and the LLVM IR for the functions in the source code, several LLVM optimization passes can be selectively applied to enhance performance based on observed execution patterns, loop characteristics, and function details. Here are suitable optimization passes:

### 1. **Function Inlining (`inline` and `always-inline`)**
   - **Rationale**: There are function calls (`find_max` and `find_min` in `main`) that are potential targets for inlining to eliminate function call overhead and enable further optimizations locally.
   - **Suggested Pass**: `inline`

### 2. **Loop Invariant Code Motion (`licm`)**
   - **Rationale**: To optimize repeated calculations and memory loads that do not change across loop iterations in the `find_max`, `find_min`, and `main` functions.
   - **Suggested Pass**: `licm`

### 3. **Loop Unrolling (`loop-unroll`)**
   - **Rationale**: For small loops with predictable branches, especially noted in `main` and sub-loop blocks. Unrolling can improve performance by reducing loop overhead.
   - **Suggested Pass**: `loop-unroll`

### 4. **Branch Prediction and Loop Rotation (`loop-rotate`)**
   - **Rationale**: The highly predictable branches (e.g., `0.9545` probability in `find_max` and `find_min` for branching to label `%13`) indicate potential benefits from re-orienting loops to place likely branches near the preheader, reducing mispredictions.
   - **Suggested Pass**: `loop-rotate`

### 5. **Basic Block Placement (`block-placement`)**
   - **Rationale**: To arrange basic blocks in a manner that adheres more closely to the predicted probabilities, improving cache locality and branch prediction accuracy on modern CPUs.
   - **Suggested Pass**: `block-placement`

### 6. **Dead Code Elimination (`dce`)**
   - **Rationale**: To remove unreferenced variables or redundant stores which can free up computation resources and simplify the code.
   - **Suggested Pass**: `dce`

### 7. **Scalar Replacement of Aggregates (`sroa`)**
   - **Rationale**: To optimize memory access patterns by breaking aggregates into individual scalar values, particularly for variables being loaded and stored repeatedly in loops.
   - **Suggested Pass**: `sroa`

### 8. **Memory to Register Promotion (`mem2reg`)**
   - **Rationale**: To reduce load/store overhead by promoting memory-based variables (`alloca`) to faster, register-based storage.
   - **Suggested Pass**: `mem2reg`

### 9. **Conditional Propagation and Constant Folding (`sccp` and `instcombine`)**
   - **Rationale**: To optimize and reduce complex expressions and constants, folding them early in static conditions, and propagating them where possible.
   - **Suggested Pass**: `sccp` and `instcombine`

### Applying these Passes
Apply these passes in an order that moves from global to local changes; first apply function-wide optimizations like inlining, then focus on loop-related optimizations, and finally apply instruction-level optimizations. This staged approach helps in progressively refining the IR for better outcomes in compilation and runtime performance.

GPT-4 PROMPT 2:
Certainly! Let’s focus on two significant inefficiencies in the LLVM IR code provided: redundant memory operations, and the non-optimal use of loop structures. I’ll provide a step-by-step guide on how to optimize these using specific LLVM transformation passes.

### 1. Optimizing Redundant Memory Operations
The code excessively uses `alloca` for storing variables that are frequently loaded and stored within the functions, which could instead be handled more efficiently in registers. This can be optimized using the LLVM `mem2reg` pass.

#### Optimization using `mem2reg` Pass:
The `mem2reg` pass is designed to promote memory-resident values to SSA (Single Static Assignment) form, which replaces stack-based allocation with register-based allocation wherever possible. This improves access speeds and opens up more opportunities for subsequent optimizations.

**How to Apply:**
- Run the `mem2reg` pass on the entire module. This pass will analyze all `alloca` instructions and try to replace them with SSA values that are not stored on the stack but held in registers.
- After conversion, variables that do not require complex address handling and do not escape the function can be handled much more efficiently.

**Expected Improvements:**
- Reduced load and store operations, leading to fewer memory accesses.
- Enhanced opportunities for other optimizations like constant propagation and instruction combining since values are now in SSA form and easier to track through computation.

Here’s a command line example on how to apply `mem2reg`:
```bash
opt -mem2reg custom2.ll -S -o optimized.ll
```

### 2. Streamlining Loop Structures
The current loop structures within `@find_max` and `@find_min` involve invariant computations inside loops and unoptimized progressions that impact performance negatively. This could be better arranged using the `loop-invariant-code-motion` pass.

#### Optimization using `licm` (Loop Invariant Code Motion) Pass:
Loop Invariant Code Motion pass moves operations that produce the same result regardless of the number of iterations of the loop outside of the loop. This decreases the number of instructions executed per iteration.

**How to Apply:**
- Run the `licm` pass to detect operations in loops that do not depend on the loop variable and can be moved out of the loop. 
- Since this transformation decreases the loop’s complexity and the number of operations performed during each iteration, it generally improves the performance.

**Expected Improvements:**
- Reduced computational load within the loops, since invariant instructions are pre-computed before the loop begins.
- Potential reduction in iteration time leading to decreased overall execution time of loops.

Optimizing loop structure can be done individually or as part of a suite of optimizations that handle loop transformations:
```bash
opt -loop-reduce -loop-unroll -licm custom2.ll -S -o optimized.ll
```

### Practical Application
Implementing these optimizations in a practical workflow would ideally involve:
1. Coarse analysis using tools like `llvm-analyze` to identify problem spots.
2. Application of specific passes as suggested.
3. Testing and verification to ensure functionality remains correct and performance is genuinely enhanced.
4. Iterative refinement, possibly tweaking function attributes and reapplying different optimization passes based on more detailed profiling results.

Applying these transformations will significantly affect the performance aspects of your LLVM IR code by optimizing memory usage and enhancing loop efficiency.

GPT-4 PROMPT 3:
When approaching the optimization of this LLVM IR code, the first focus would be on addressing specific inefficiencies and structural enhancements. Several transformation passes are chosen based on their ability to optimize control flow, reduce redundancy, and streamline computations within this specific context.

### Step 1: Control Flow and Basic Optimization
1. **Instcombine (Instruction Combining)** — Considering that the code contains multiple arithmetic and bit manipulation instructions that can be combined into fewer operations. For example, repeated calculations in loops (such as `sitofp i32 %15 to double` followed by `fmul double %14, %16`) can potentially be simplified.

2. **Simplifycfg (Control Flow Graph Simplification)** — Use this pass to remove redundant control flow elements, merge basic blocks if possible, and simplify conditional branches. This would assist with the organization and branching within the loops, making the code more linear and potentially uncovering further optimization possibilities.

3. **Reassociate (Reassociation of Expressions)** — Helpful in optimizing the sequence of operations, particularly within arithmetic and logical computations across the multiple basic blocks, to reduce computation time and join related operations more efficiently.

### Step 2: Loop Optimizations
1. **Loop-unroll (Loop Unrolling)** — Given that the loops might be principal components of running time, especially with the iterations internal to `find_max` and `find_min`, unrolling them would expand loops at compile time, reducing iteration overhead and increasing the locality of reference, potentially enhancing cache performance.

2. **Indvars (Induction Variable Simplification)** — Simplifies loop induction variables where simple canonical induction variables are used (e.g., `i32 %34 = add nsw i32 %34, 1`). This would streamline the iterations and potentially open opportunities for other optimizations.

### Step 3: Function Level and Data Handling Optimizations
1. **Mem2reg (Promotes Memory to Register)** — Essential for reducing the overhead of repeated memory access through `alloca` and `store` operations in the code, promoting stack variables to registers when possible. This should significantly enhance access times and optimize space.

2. **Dead Code Elimination (DCE)** — To clean up any operations that become unnecessary after earlier optimizations, including computations that do not contribute to the final results or dead stores.

3. **Inline Functions** - The `inline` transformation attempts to replace calls to `find_max` and `find_min` directly with their bodies if the overall cost-benefit analysis justifies it. Inlining such functions can reduce function call overhead and may result in more extensive code-level optimizations within the `main` function.

### Step 4: Advanced Optimizations
1. **GVN (Global Value Numbering)** — To eliminate redundant calculations shared among different blocks (possibly even between iterations of loops), by analyzing computation across branches.

2. **IPSCCP (Interprocedural Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation)** — Given @find_max and @find_min are relatively static in their behavior across program runs, propagating constants and simplifying conditions based on invariant arguments can further simplify control flow.

In executing these passes, the optimizer should maintain the careful balance between enhancing computation speed and not excessively enlarging binary size, particularly with respect to loop unrolling and function inlining. Each optimization pass might change the IR significantly in ways that can then be exploited by subsequent passes, which is why the ordering of these transformations and observing their interplay is crucial.
